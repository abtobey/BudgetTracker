# Exercise Tracker

## This is a web app which tracks the user's budget over time and allows to enter expenses and revenue. This app uses a service worker and IndexedDb, so it can be run off line as soon as the page has been loaded. Once an internet connection is re-established, all cached data is sent to the MongoDB server.
